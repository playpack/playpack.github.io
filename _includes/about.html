              <h2>At PlayPack we create free-to-play mobile games. Our long time dream is to bring true social experiences back to casual gaming space. Remember when true social was cool? When people played games together keeping their social network connections not only through photos and posts, but through those games? Casual space on mobile could really use a new angle on social experiences for the underserved casual audiences. And we are working hard to make this happen.</h2>
